# My Portfolio  
  Hi! My name is Thomas and this is my portfolio to show off some web development I have learned. This site uses HTML, CSS, JS, and is organized using React.<br /> 
  [Demo Video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/WgG7QoYJdmN7U8ZGArrZ)<br />
  This site presents the user with 3 different pages, all while having a presisting header with a navbar, as well as a footer with links to download my resume or go to external sites.<br />
  The 3 pages are:
   - The Homepage/About Me
   - Projects I have made/worked on
   - A Contact Me page to submit an email 

  On the `Homepage`, I have put a quick few sentances about myself, and listed out some of my experience and certifications.<br />
  On `Projects`, 6 projects have been listed out, with links to their live sites or Git repositories.<br />
  The `Contact Me` has a form for the user to fill out to an email. This email is handled via `EmailJS`, and the user has to fill the entire form out with a valid email to be able to submit.<br />
